NAME
    DBIx::AutoReconnect - restart DBI calls after reconnecting on failure

DESCRIPTION
    The module wraps "DBI->connect" call with "DBIx::AutoReconnect->connect"
    call so that any operation with DB connection handle that fails due to
    connection break ( server shutdown, tcp reset etc etc), is automatically
    reconnected.

    The module is useful when a little more robustness is desired for a
    cheap price; the proper DB failure resistance should of course be
    inherent to the program logic.

SYNOPSIS
         use DBIx::AutoReconnect;

         my $dbh = DBIx::AutoReconnect-> connect(
               "dbi:Pg:dbname=template1",
               "postgres",
               "password",
               {
                    PrintError => 0,
                    ReconnectTimeout => 5,
                    ReconnectFailure => sub { warn "oops!" },
               },
         );

USAGE
    "DBIx::AutoReconnect" contains a single method "get_handle" that returns
    underlying DBI handle, returned from "DBI->connect()".

    The module-specific knobs that can be directly assigned to the object
    handle, are described below

    ReconnectFailure &SUB
        Called when "DBI->connect" call fails.

    ReconnectTimeout $SECONDS
        Seconds to sleep after reconnection attempt fails.

        Default: 60

    ReconnectMaxTries $INTEGER
        Max number of tries before giving up. The connections are tried
        indefinitely if "undef".

        Default: 5

NOTES
    Transactions are not restarted if connection breaks, moreover,
    "begin_work", "rollback", and "commit" die when called, to protect from
    unintentional use. To use transactions, operate with the original DBI
    handle returned by "get_handle". "AutoCommit" is allowed though.

    "RaiseError" is mostly useless with this module, because the DBI errors
    that may raise the exception, are all wrapped in eval by the connection
    detector code. The only place where it is useful, is when
    "ReconnectMaxTries" tries are exhausted, and depending on "RaiseError",
    the code dies or returns "undef" from the <connect> call.
